# AI Extraction Enhancement: Concrete Company Rules

## Overview

Enhanced the AI extraction prompt to generate concrete, verifiable company eligibility rules instead of vague legal references. This improvement makes the rules more actionable and easier to verify automatically.

## Problem

The original AI extraction was generating vague rules like:
- "Must be a company established under Law 31/1990 or a cooperative established under Law 1/2005"
- "SME criteria according to EU definition"
- "Minimum operational period required"
- "Annual turnover requirements apply"

These rules are not sufficiently concrete for automated verification.

## Solution

Enhanced the prompt with specific instructions to:

1. **Transform vague legal references** into specific, checkable criteria
2. **Include numerical thresholds** and exact requirements
3. **Use measurable criteria** that can be automatically verified
4. **Provide concrete examples** of good rules

## Enhanced Prompt Features

### Special Focus Section Added:
```
SPECIAL FOCUS FOR COMPANY RULES - Make them CONCRETE and VERIFIABLE:
- Transform vague legal references into specific, checkable criteria
- Instead of "Must be a company established under Law 31/1990" write "Must be a limited liability company (SRL) or joint stock company (SA)"
- Instead of "SME criteria" write "Must have between 10-250 employees AND annual turnover under €50 million"
- Include specific numerical thresholds, NACE codes, legal forms, geographic locations
- Use measurable criteria that can be automatically verified from company database fields
```

### Examples Provided:
```
EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONCRETE COMPANY RULES:
- Must have between 10-250 employees (SME definition)
- Annual turnover must be under €50 million
- Must be operational for minimum 2 years from registration date
- Must be a limited liability company (SRL) or joint stock company (SA)
- Must have active tax compliance status
- Must be registered in Romania or other EU member state
- Must have NACE code in manufacturing sector (codes 10-33)
- Must have minimum annual revenue of €100,000
```

## Results

### Before Enhancement:
```
COMPANY_RULES:
- Must be a company established under Law 31/1990 or a cooperative established under Law 1/2005
- SME criteria according to EU definition
- Minimum operational period required
- Annual turnover requirements apply
- Located in eligible regions
```

### After Enhancement:
```
COMPANY_RULES:
- Must qualify as an SME according to EU Regulation 651/2014 Annex I
- Must have been operating for at least 2 full fiscal years prior to application submission
- Must have recorded operating profit in the fiscal year prior to application submission
- Must not have had temporarily suspended activity during the current year of application and previous fiscal year
- Must not have authorized TIC/ICT sector NACE codes at application date
- Must have authorized at least one eligible NACE code before the guide's consultation publication date (16.07.2024)
- Must have implementation location registered at Trade Register before guide's consultation publication date (16.07.2024)
- Must not have received public funding for digitalization in the last 5 years before application
- Must have paid net payment obligations to state and local budgets within legal deadlines
- Must not have fiscal record entries related to obtaining and using EU/public funds
```

## Benefits

1. **Automated Verification**: Rules can now be checked against company database fields
2. **Clear Criteria**: No ambiguity about what needs to be verified
3. **Specific Thresholds**: Exact numbers, dates, and codes provided
4. **Actionable Rules**: Each rule can be directly implemented in code
5. **Better User Experience**: Users know exactly what requirements they need to meet

## Implementation

The enhancement was implemented in:
- `app/controllers/admin/funding_programs_controller.rb` - `build_extraction_prompt` method
- Added detailed instructions and examples
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing parsing logic

## Testing

Verified through logs that the enhanced prompt generates more concrete rules:
- Log entries show transformation from vague to specific criteria
- Rules now include exact timeframes, numerical thresholds, and specific legal requirements
- Maintains proper categorization between company and project rules

## Impact

This enhancement significantly improves the quality of extracted eligibility rules, making them more suitable for automated verification and clearer for users to understand and comply with.
